#Given an array arr[] denoting heights of n towers and a positive integer k.For each tower, you must perform exactly one of the following operations exactly once. 
#Increase the height of the tower by k. Decrease the height of the tower by k. Find out the minimum possible difference between the height of the shortest and tallest towers after you have modified each tower. 
class Solution:
    def getMinDiff(self, arr, k):
        n = len(arr)

        if n == 1:
            return 0

        arr.sort()
        ans = arr[n-1] - arr[0]

        for i in range(1, n):
            if arr[i] - k < 0:
                continue

            smallest = min(arr[0] + k, arr[i] - k)
            largest = max(arr[i-1] + k, arr[n-1] - k)

            ans = min(ans, largest - smallest)

        return ans
