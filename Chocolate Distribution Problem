#Given an array arr[] of positive integers, where each value represents the number of chocolates in a packet. Each packet can have a variable number of chocolates. There are m students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets among m students such that - 
#      i. Each student gets exactly one packet. 
#     ii. The difference between maximum number of chocolates given to a student and minimum number of chocolates given to a student is minimum and return that minimum possible difference.
