#You are given a 2D binary array arr[][] consisting of only 1s and 0s. Each row of the array is sorted in non-decreasing order. Your task is to find and return the index of the first row that contains the maximum number of 1s. If no such row exists, return -1.
class Solution:
    def rowWithMax1s(self, arr):
        n = len(arr)
        m = len(arr[0]) if n > 0 else 0

        max_row = -1
        j = m - 1  

        for i in range(n):
            while j >= 0 and arr[i][j] == 1:
                j -= 1
                max_row = i

        return max_row
