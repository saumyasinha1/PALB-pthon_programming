#Given two sorted arrays a[] and b[] of size n and m respectively, the task is to merge them in sorted order without using any extra space. Modify a[] so that it contains the first n elements and modify b[] so that it contains the last m elements. 
class Solution:
    def mergeArrays(self, a, b):

        n = len(a)
        m = len(b)

        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] > b[0]:
                a[i], b[0] = b[0], a[i]
                first = b[0]
                k = 1

                while k < m and b[k] < first:
                    b[k - 1] = b[k]
                    k += 1

                b[k - 1] = first
